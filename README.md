# easier-proofs
This project aims to help making proofs easier. This tool is using the `Coq` Proof Assistance.

## How to use it

The [`crush`](https://github.com/jwiegley/coq-haskell/blob/master/src/Crush.v) custom tactic of [Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net/) from certified programming with dependent types is widely use in this project.

Let us consider this simple example with the commutative property of addition on natural numbers.

First of all, we have this OCaml code.

```ocaml
type nat =
  | Zero
  | S of nat

let pred (n : nat) : nat = match n with
  | Zero -> Zero
  | S p -> p

let rec add (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat = match n with
  | Zero -> m
  | S p -> S (add p m)
```

We generate the Coq code for this Ocaml code by using the tool [**coq-of-ocaml**](https://github.com/foobar-land/coq-of-ocaml).

```coq
Inductive nat : Set :=
| Zero : nat
| S : nat -> nat.

Definition pred (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | Zero => Zero
  | S p => p
  end.

Fixpoint add (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | Zero => m
  | S p => S (add p m)
  end.
```

In order to prove the commutative property of the addition, we have to prove these two lemmas first:
  - n + 0 = n
  - S (x + y) = x + (S y)

We are using the [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) (Domain-specific language) to express properties that we want to prove.

This OCaml code 

```ocaml
to_proofs [
    block "commutative property of Nat addition" [
      prop "add_right_zero" ~context:(forall [("n","nat")]) ((atom "add n Zero" =.= atom "n") >> induction "n");

      prop "add_s" ~context:(forall [("x","nat");("y","nat")]) ((atom "S (add x y)" =.= atom "add x (S y)") >> induction "x");

      prop "add_commut"
        ~context:(forall [("x","nat");("y","nat")])
        ((atom "add x y" =.= atom "add y x") >> induction "x")
        ~axioms:["add_right_zero";"add_s"]
    ]
  ]
```
express the two needed lemmas above and the commutative.

The code below is the Coq proof automatically generated from the OCaml DSL code above.

```coq

## Build the source code

First we need to build our source code by `make`.
To run the test, simply do `make test`.
